# Stock Market Analysis Project

This project analyses historical stock market data using Python, focusing on trend analysis over the past decade. The analysis employs various technical approaches including machine learning models and distributed computing.

## Key Features

- Historical stock data processing using Dask for large datasets
- Technical analysis with scikit-learn models
- Pattern recognition and trend identification
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Visualization of market trends and indicators

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OGreenwood672/stock_trends.git
   cd stock_trends
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ### Windows:

   - Open a terminal in the repository directory.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   ### Linux/Mac:

   - Open a terminal in the repository directory.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```

3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

   - To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
     ```
     deactivate
     ```

4. **Reactivating the Virtual Environment:**

   - Every time you return to the project, you need to activate the virtual environment before running any scripts:

     ### Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     ### Linux/Mac:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
