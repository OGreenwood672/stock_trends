K Means Clustering on Number of Ticketers, Number of Ticketers - 1, ..., 2
Count the number of times pairs of ticketers are in the same group and divide by number of ticketers.
Have a cut off threshold and visualise via nodes and links.
Alternativly, just stop at cluster at clusters = number of ticketers / 1.5
